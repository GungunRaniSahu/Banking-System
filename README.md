<h1> Banking System (C++ OOP) </h1>
Description 

This project is a simple Banking System implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. The system allows users to create, deposit, withdraw, and check the balance of their bank accounts. It features both Savings and Current accounts, utilizing core OOP principles like Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

Features
Account Creation: Users can open a Savings or Current account.
Deposit/Withdrawal: Secure deposit and withdrawal functionality.
Interest Calculation: Interest is calculated and added to Savings accounts.
Overdraft Protection: Current accounts can handle overdraft limits.
Balance Display: Users can check their account balance anytime.
OOP Concepts Used
Encapsulation: Account details (like balance and account number) are hidden from the outside world and accessed via methods.
Inheritance: Common features (like deposit and withdraw methods) are inherited in the SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount classes.
Polymorphism: Different behaviors (e.g., withdrawal rules) are implemented for different account types using function overriding.
Requirements
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
C++11 or later for best compatibility
