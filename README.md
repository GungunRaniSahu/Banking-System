<h1> Banking System (C++ OOP) </h1>
Description <br>
This project is a simple <b>Banking System</b> implemented using <b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> concepts in C++. The system allows users to create, deposit, withdraw, and check the balance of their bank accounts. It features both <b>Savings</b> and <b>Current</b> accounts, utilizing core OOP principles like <b>Encapsulation,</b> <b>Inheritance,</b> and <b>Polymorphism. </b>
<br><br>
Features <br>
Account Creation: Users can open a Savings or Current account.

Deposit/Withdrawal: Secure deposit and withdrawal functionality.

Interest Calculation: Interest is calculated and added to Savings accounts.

Overdraft Protection: Current accounts can handle overdraft limits.

Balance Display: Users can check their account balance anytime.

OOP Concepts Used <br>
Encapsulation: Account details (like balance and account number) are hidden from the outside world and accessed via methods.

Inheritance: Common features (like deposit and withdraw methods) are inherited in the SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount classes.

Polymorphism: Different behaviors (e.g., withdrawal rules) are implemented for different account types using function overriding.

Requirements <br>
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
C++11 or later for best compatibility
