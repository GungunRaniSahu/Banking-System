<h1> Banking System (C++ OOP) </h1>
Description: <br>
This project is a simple <b>Banking System</b> implemented using <b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> concepts in C++. The system allows users to create, deposit, withdraw, and check the balance of their bank accounts. It features both <b>Savings</b> and <b>Current</b> accounts, utilizing core OOP principles like <b>Encapsulation,</b> <b>Inheritance,</b> and <b>Polymorphism. </b>
<br><br>
Features: <br>
Account Creation: Users can open a Savings or Current account. <br>
Deposit/Withdrawal: Secure deposit and withdrawal functionality. <br>
Interest Calculation: Interest is calculated and added to Savings accounts. <br>
Overdraft Protection: Current accounts can handle overdraft limits. <br>
Balance Display: Users can check their account balance anytime. <br>
<br>
OOP Concepts Used: <br>
Encapsulation: Account details (like balance and account number) are hidden from the outside world and accessed via methods. <br>
Inheritance: Common features (like deposit and withdraw methods) are inherited in the Savings Account and Current Account classes. <br>
Polymorphism: Different behaviors (e.g., withdrawal rules) are implemented for different account types using function overriding. <br>
<br>
Requirements: <br>
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) <br>
C++11 or later for best compatibility
